# Chapter-2: Working with text data

## Understanding Word Embeddings
**Deep neural network models**, including LLMs, cannot process raw text directly. Since text is **categorical**, it isn’t compatible with the **mathematical operations** used to implement and train neural networks. Therefore, we need a way to represent words as **continuous-valued vectors**.
